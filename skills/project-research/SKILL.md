# Lion Environmental: Nightly Research & Ideation

Two phases: Research then Ideate.

## Phase 1: Research

Focus: NYC Local Law 97 carbon compliance deadlines, lead paint inspection regulations, Rockland County property management, building compliance mandates, property management company news.

Sources (in order):
1. https://www.nyc.gov/site/buildings/index.page (DOB announcements)
2. https://www.rocklandgov.com
3. NYC real estate / property management news (freshness=pd)
4. Broad search freshness=pd: "NYC LL97 compliance 2026" or "lead paint inspection NYC"

Read knowledge/_sources.md first. No re-ingestion.
Write to knowledge/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic].md. Update _sources.md.

## Phase 2: Ideate

Based on tonight's research — and anything else you know about the current state of all projects — identify ONE concrete opportunity worth flagging to Tom.

**No boundaries.** It does not have to be related to this project. It can be:
- A new business idea triggered by something in the research
- A cross-project connection nobody has noticed
- A tool, API, or platform worth exploiting
- A market inefficiency, regulatory gap, or timing play
- Something completely outside current projects that fits the infrastructure

The only filter: it should be specific, actionable, and ideally something Junior can own or Tom can act on in 48 hours.

Write as final section of tonight's knowledge file:
```
## Tonight's Recommendation
**What:** [one sentence — specific, not vague]
**Why now:** [what triggered this — research finding, pattern, timing]
**How:** [exact first step to execute]
**Who executes:** Junior autonomously / Tom makes one call / Tom decides first
**Impact:** [High/Med/Low] | **Effort:** [Hours/Days/Weeks]
```

One recommendation only. If you have two good ones, pick the bolder one.
