# Apollo.io Proposal — Lion Environmental + Site Safety Staffing

## What Apollo Is

Apollo is a database of 210 million+ business contacts. It knows who works where, what their title is, and has their verified email and phone number. Instead of scraping Google Maps and guessing who to contact, Apollo already has the decision-makers on file.

We plug Apollo into our system and it powers the entire outreach pipeline — finding leads, getting their contact info, and feeding them into cold email automatically. No manual work.

## Lead Paint Testing (What We're Doing Now)

We have 4,000+ property management leads in the system, but a lot of them are missing emails and contact names. Can't cold email someone if you don't have their email.

With Apollo:

- Day 1: We upload our 4,000 leads. Apollo matches them against its database and fills in the missing emails and contact names. Results come back same day.
- Every month after: The system automatically searches Apollo for new property management contacts in NYC — owners, directors, operations managers. New contacts get added to our system and enrolled in the cold email sequence automatically.
- We get verified emails for the actual decision-maker, not a generic info@ address. Better emails means better response rates.
- We also get job titles, LinkedIn profiles, company size, and seniority level — so we can prioritize the bigger fish first.

This replaces Apify (the Google Maps scraper) and the enrichment script we're currently using. One tool instead of two. Simpler, less that can break.

## Site Safety Staffing (The New Business Idea)

NYC requires a certified Site Safety Manager or Coordinator on every construction site while work is happening. The city recently lowered the threshold — buildings 7+ stories now need one, down from 10. That means more construction sites need these people than ever before.

The idea: we deploy certified site safety professionals to construction companies that need them. We're the staffing company — GCs and developers come to us when they need a site safety person.

Apollo helps here the exact same way:

- Search Apollo for construction company contacts in NYC — general contractors, developers, construction managers, project directors.
- Get verified emails for the people who actually hire site safety staff.
- Feed them into a cold email sequence tailored to site safety services.
- Every month, new construction contacts get discovered and added automatically.

Same tool, same pipeline, different audience. We'd run two separate outreach tracks — one for property managers (lead paint) and one for construction companies (site safety) — both powered by Apollo.

## The Cost

$49 per month. $588 per year.

That includes 30,000 credits per year. Each contact costs 1 credit to enrich. Between both businesses — lead paint and site safety — we'd use well under half of what's included, even being aggressive with outreach.

For reference, the only alternative with similar data quality is ZoomInfo at $15,000+ per year with a mandatory annual contract.

## What This Looks Like Day to Day

Once it's set up, nobody needs to touch it. The system finds new contacts, gets their emails, and sends outreach on a schedule. Avi gets replies in his inbox. When someone's interested, it shows up in the CRM and Avi takes over from there.

Two businesses running outbound outreach on autopilot for less than $50 a month.
