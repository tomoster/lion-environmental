## NYC / Default

**Subject:** Quick question about {{company}}

### Step 1

Hi {{first_name}},

I run a lead paint testing company in the NJ/NYC area. With the Local Law 31 deadlines coming up, a lot of property managers are scrambling to get inspections done.

We handle everything - full-building XRF inspections with reports ready in 48-72 hours.

Would it make sense to chat for 5 minutes about your buildings?

### Step 2

Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my last note. NYC just expanded enforcement on Local Law 31 - fines start at $1,000 per unit for non-compliance, and they're actively issuing violations.

We do full-building inspections with certified reports, typically turned around in 2-3 days. Happy to give you a quick quote if you want to compare pricing.

### Step 3

Hi {{first_name}},

Just finished a 24-unit building inspection in Jersey City - results back in 2 days, client was happy with the pricing.

If you're shopping around for lead paint testing, happy to put together a comparison quote. No pressure either way.

## Rockland County

**Subject:** Quick question about {{company}}

### Step 1

Hi {{first_name}},

I run a lead paint testing company serving the Rockland County area. New York State requires lead paint inspections for all pre-1980 multi-family rental properties - and Rockland County is offering up to $40,000 per unit in remediation grants for landlords who get inspected.

We handle everything - full-building XRF inspections with certified reports in 48-72 hours.

Would it make sense to chat for 5 minutes about your properties?

### Step 2

Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my last note. With 80% of Rockland County homes built before 1978, most multi-family rentals require lead paint inspections under NY State law. The county's remediation grant program ($40k/unit) requires an inspection first - it's a good time to get ahead of it.

We do full-building inspections with certified reports, typically turned around in 2-3 days. Happy to give you a quick quote.

### Step 3

Hi {{first_name}},

Just finished inspecting a multi-family property in New City - results back in 2 days. The owner is applying for the Rockland County remediation grant, which covers up to $40k per unit.

If you've been thinking about getting your buildings inspected, happy to put together a quote. No pressure either way.
