## NYC / Default

**Subject:** `Quick question, {{first_name}}`

### Step 1

Hi {{first_name}},

Local Law 31 deadlines are putting a lot of pressure on NYC property managers right now — buildings need to be inspected or fines start at $1,000 per unit.

We do full-building XRF inspections with certified reports ready in 48-72 hours.

Worth a quick conversation about your portfolio?

### Step 2

Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my last note. NYC enforcement on Local Law 31 is picking up — violations are being issued and fines start at $1,000 per unit.

We handle full-building inspections with certified reports, typically in 2-3 days. Happy to put together a quick quote if you want to see numbers.

Worth it?

### Step 3

Hi {{first_name}},

Just wrapped up a 24-unit inspection in Jersey City — certified report delivered in 2 days, owner submitted for compliance the same week.

If your buildings still need to be checked off, happy to put together a quote. Faster turnaround than most.

Worth a look?

## Rockland County

**Subject:** `Quick question, {{first_name}}`

### Step 1

Hi {{first_name}},

New York State requires lead paint inspections for pre-1980 rental properties — and Rockland County's remediation grant covers up to $40,000 per unit for landlords who get inspected first.

We do full-building XRF inspections with certified reports in 48-72 hours.

Worth a quick conversation about your properties?

### Step 2

Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my last note. With most Rockland County rentals built before 1978, the state inspection requirement applies to almost every multi-family portfolio in the area.

The county grant ($40K per unit) requires an inspection first — worth getting ahead of it.

Happy to put together a quick quote.

### Step 3

Hi {{first_name}},

Just finished a property in New City — owner is applying for the Rockland County remediation grant this month. The inspection report is the first thing they ask for.

If you've been sitting on this, happy to get you a quote this week.

Worth it?
