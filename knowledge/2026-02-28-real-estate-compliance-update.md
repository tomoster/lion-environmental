## Key Findings

### 1. Local Law 97 (LL97) & Carbon Compliance
*   **New Pilot Program:** The NYC FY27 Preliminary Budget (released mid-Feb 2026) proposes $1.8M annually for a **Local Law 97 Compliance Delivery Pilot Program**. This initiative aims to provide "all-in-one" financing and technical assistance, utilizing city bulk purchasing to lower retrofit costs for building owners.
*   **2026 Reporting:** 94% of covered buildings (>25k sq. ft.) have filed initial documents or extensions. The focus has shifted to strict enforcement of carbon caps, with a $268/metric ton penalty for non-compliance.
*   **Energy Code Updates:** NYC officially adopted the **2025 Energy Codes** on February 2, 2026, mandating "smart electrification" for new constructions.
*   **Refrigerant Mandates:** New AIM Act mandates for HVAC refrigerants took effect in February 2026, impacting facility managers' retrofit plans.

### 2. Rockland County Real Estate Market
*   **Commercial Activity:** Significant deals closed this week, including a Nyack self-storage facility for **$12.5M** and the Airport Executive Park for **$9.5M**.
*   **Residential Snapshot:** Median list price stands at **$799,945** with 423 active listings. Median days on market is 85 days.
*   **Development:** Plans advanced for the Shoprite Plaza redevelopment in New City, featuring a five-story residential component.
*   **Incentives:** Builders are increasingly offering mortgage rate buydowns (some in the 4% range) to combat buyer hesitation.

### 3. NYC Commercial Property Management
*   **"Flight to Quality":** Demand is heavily concentrated in Class A office spaces with high-end amenities and sustainability certifications. 
*   **Office-to-Residential:** Square footage of conversions is expected to double in 2026 compared to 2025, driven by new tax incentives and zoning adjustments.
*   **Retail Shifts:** Blackstone sold *The Shops at Skyview* for **$297.8M** on February 26, indicating active portfolio rebalancing by institutional players.

## Implications
The project should prioritize the **NYC Accelerator** and the new **Compliance Delivery Pilot Program** when advising clients on LL97, as bulk purchasing may significantly reduce retrofit costs. In Rockland County, the focus should be on New City redevelopment and industrial/storage asset classes which remain highly liquid.

## Raw Notes
*   NYC Transaction Volume (last 24h): 124 transactions, $224M total.
*   Average Manhattan Office Rent: ~$78.37/sq. ft.
*   Rockland Conservation: 16 acres added to Orange County Land Trust in Rockland this week.
