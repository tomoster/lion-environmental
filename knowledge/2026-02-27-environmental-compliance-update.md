## Key Findings

### Federal EPA - Stricter Lead Dust Standards (Effective Jan 12, 2026)
- **New dust-lead hazard action levels**: 5 µg/ft² (floors), 40 µg/ft² (window sills), 100 µg/ft² (window troughs)
- **Post-abatement clearance levels**: Reduced 50-75% from previous standards
- **Penalties**: Up to $40,000 per violation
- **Enforcement**: Active as of January 12, 2026 - enforcement deadline passed

### NYC Local Rule Amendment (Effective Feb 2, 2026)
- Property owners can now challenge violations using XRF test results
- New appeals pathway if XRF testing demonstrates absence of lead-based paint
- Requires valid XRF documentation

### NYC Enforcement Trends
- New city administration emphasizing tenant protections and code enforcement
- FY2024: $400,000+ in civil penalties collected by HPD
- 16 new violation cases initiated in FY24
- $2.97M spent on remediation/abatement work
- Recent mailings reminding property owners of annual notice duties

### Grant Opportunities - FY2026 HUD Lead Hazard Reduction Program
- **Total funding**: $364.5 million available
- **LHRD grants**: $120.1M for highest need areas
- **LBPHC grants**: $203M for all other jurisdictions
- **Healthy Homes Supplemental**: $41.4M for health hazard repairs
- **Eligible applicants**: States, cities, counties, tribes
- **Grant amounts**: Up to $7M (buildings with 3,500+ pre-1940 units), up to $4M (first-time grantees)

## Implications

The EPA's stricter enforcement and lower dust-lead thresholds mean more rigorous testing and clearance requirements for all RRP work. NYC's new XRF-based appeals process provides property owners with a compliance pathway while enforcement activity intensifies under the current administration. The $364.5M in federal grant funding presents significant opportunities for NYC property owners and environmental service providers.
